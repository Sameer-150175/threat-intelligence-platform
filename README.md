~~~

GET /api/findings returns the latest stored analysis results.

GET /api/health returns service health.

~~~

## Screenshots

Add screenshots after running the dashboard:

- Dashboard overview
- API response sample
- Findings history

## Security Considerations

- Use only on assets you own or are explicitly authorized to assess.
- Do not commit secrets or API keys.
- Add authentication before public exposure.
- Review logs for sensitive data before sharing demonstrations.

## Professional Commit Examples

- feat: add scored analysis workflow
- test: cover service scoring output
- docs: add deployment and security notes
